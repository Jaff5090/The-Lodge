# The Lodge  :
The Questionnaire application for Android developed in Kotlin uses a welcome activity to allow the user to register. After registration, the user can use a Recycler View to choose the quiz topic.

Once the theme has been chosen, the user accesses a questionnaire using navigation by tabs at the bottom of the screen. This questionnaire has two different fragments for questions and answers.

When taking a quiz, the user receives a score based on the number of questions answered correctly. This score can be displayed using a progress bar or a percentage.

In general, this app provides a user-friendly experience for users who want to take quizzes on various topics.
