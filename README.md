# The Lodge  :
The Android application developed in Kotlin, called the The Lodge, uses a welcome activity to enable the user to sign up. After the registration process is complete, the user can use a [Recycler View](https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView) to select the quiz's subject matter.

Upon choosing the theme, the user navigates to the questionnaire through tabs located at [the bottom of the screen (https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomnavigation/BottomNavigationView). The questionnaire is divided into two separate fragments for questions and answers.

When participating in the quiz, the user will receive a score based on the number of correctly answered questions. This score can be represented using a progress bar or expressed as a percentage.

Overall, the app provides an intuitive experience for users seeking to take quizzes on various subjects.
