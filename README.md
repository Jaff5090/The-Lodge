  <h3>The Lodge:</h3>
  <p>The Android application developed in Kotlin, called the The Lodge, uses a welcome activity to enable the user to sign up. After the registration process is complete, the user can use a Recycler View to select the quiz's subject matter.</p>
  <p>Upon choosing the theme, the user navigates to the questionnaire through tabs located at the bottom of the screen . The questionnaire is divided into two separate fragments for questions and answers.</p>
  <p>When participating in the quiz, the user will receive a score based on the number of correctly answered questions. This score can be represented using a progress bar or expressed as a percentage.</p>
  <p>Overall, the app provides an intuitive experience for users seeking to take quizzes on various subjects.</p>
